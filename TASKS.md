  - [x] Add `src/morpheum-bot/message-queue.ts` and
        `src/morpheum-bot/message-queue.test.ts` to the commit.
  - [x] Replace all instances of `client.sendMessage` with `queueMessage` in
        `src/morpheum-bot/index.ts` to use the new message queue.

- [x] **Task 29: Refine Ollama Model Prompts for TDD**

  - [x] Update the `SYSTEM` prompt in `gpt-oss-120b.ollama` and
        `gpt-oss-small.ollama` to be more specific to a Test-Driven Development
        (TDD) approach.
  - [x] Reduce the `num_ctx` parameter in `gpt-oss-120b.ollama` to `65536`.
  - [x] Add `bun.lock` and `opencode.json` to the repository.

  - [x] Fixed a bug in the message queue where text and HTML messages were being
        improperly concatenated.
  - [x] Modified the batching logic to group messages by both `roomId` and
        `msgtype`.
  - [x] Added a new test case to ensure that messages of different types are not
        batched together.

- [x] **Task 31: Refactor Message Queue Logic**
  - [x] Refactored the message queue to slow down message sending to at most 1
        per second.
  - [x] Implemented new batching logic:
    - Consecutive text messages are concatenated and sent as a single message.
    - HTML messages are sent individually.
  - [x] The queue now only processes one "batch" (either a single HTML message
        or a group of text messages) per interval.
  - [x] Updated the unit tests to reflect the new logic and fixed a bug related
        to shared state between tests.

        architecture

## Phase 1: Implement the Jailed Agent Environment

The goal of this phase is to automate the setup and management of the jailed
agent environment described in `JAIL_PROTOTYPE.md` (now deprecated - see current
implementation in `jail/` directory). All scripts and configurations will be
placed in a new `jail/` directory.

- [x] **Task 1: Create the `jail` directory structure.**

  - Create a new top-level directory named `jail`.

- [x] **Task 2: Implement `jail/flake.nix`**

  - Create a `flake.nix` file inside the `jail` directory.
  - Copy the Nix code from `JAIL_PROTOTYPE.md` into this file (now implemented).

- [x] **Task 3: Create `jail/start-vm.sh` script**

  - Create a shell script that automates the `colima start` command with the
    specified port forwarding logic for multiple agent and monitoring ports.

- [x] **Task 4: Create `jail/build.sh` script**

  - Create a shell script that runs `nix build .#default` (relative to the
    `jail` directory) and `docker load < result` to build the image and load it
    into the Docker daemon.

- [x] **Task 5: Create `jail/run.sh` script**

  - Create a shell script that automates the `docker run` command.
  - The script should accept arguments for the container name (e.g., `jail-1`)
    and the port numbers to map, making it easy to launch multiple, distinct
    jails.

- [x] **Task 6: Create `jail/agent.ts` client**

  - Create the TypeScript agent client as `jail/agent.ts`.
  - Copy the TypeScript code from `JAIL_PROTOTYPE.md` into this file (now
    implemented).

- [x] **Task 7: Create `jail/README.md`**
  - Create a `README.md` file inside the `jail` directory.
  - Document how to use the new scripts (`start-vm.sh`, `build.sh`, `run.sh`,
    and `agent.ts`) to set up and interact with the jailed environment. This
    replaces the manual instructions in the original prototype document.
- [x] **Task 37: Improve Pre-commit Hook**
  - [x] Add a check to the pre-commit hook to prevent commits with unstaged
        changes.
  - [x] Add a check to the pre-commit hook to prevent commits with untracked
        files.

## Phase 2: TypeScript SWE-Agent

The goal is to replace the bot's current Gemini CLI integration with a new,
self-contained agentic workflow inspired by `mini-swe-agent`. This new agent
will use local Ollama models and the `jail` environment to execute tasks, with
the Matrix bot serving as its primary user interface.

### Foundational Modules (TDD Approach)

- [x] **Task 38: Ollama API Client**

  - [x] Create a test file: `src/morpheum-bot/ollamaClient.test.ts`. Write a
        failing test that attempts to send a prompt to a mock Ollama API
        endpoint.

  - [x] Implement a function to send a system prompt and conversation history to
        a specified model via the Ollama API.
  - [x] Make the test pass.

- [x] **Task 39: Jailed Shell Client**

  - [x] Create a test file: `src/morpheum-bot/jailClient.test.ts`. Write a
        failing test that attempts to send a command to a mock TCP server and
        receive a response.

        tests for the agent's main loop, mocking the Ollama and Jail clients.
  - [x] Create the agent module: `src/morpheum-bot/sweAgent.ts`.
  - [x] Implement the main agent loop, which will manage the conversation
        history and orchestrate calls to the Ollama client, parser, and jail
        client.

- [x] **Task 43: Matrix Bot Integration**
  - [x] Modify `src/morpheum-bot/index.ts` to add a new command, `!swe <task>`.
  - [x] When triggered, this command will initialize and run the `sweAgent` loop
        with the provided task.
  - [x] The agent's intermediate "thoughts," commands, and tool outputs will be
        formatted and sent as messages to the Matrix room.
  - [x] Add a corresponding integration test for the `!swe` command.

### Configuration and Cleanup

- [x] **Task 44: Configuration**

  - [x] Integrate necessary settings (e.g., Ollama model name, API URL, default
        jail port) into the bot's existing configuration system (using
        environment variables).

- [x] **Task 45: Deprecate Old Integration**

  - [x] Once the new `!swe` command is stable, remove the old Gemini CLI
        integration code and the `!gemini` command from
